The power plant is approximately two miles downriver of the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit.  The leak was continuous and occurred from approximately 2230 on February 9 to 0330 on February 10 and was described as flowing at the rate of a fire-hose discharge.  Oil had broken through a corroded portion of a 10-inch supply line, ran into a storm sewer, and then traveled about 100 feet to enter the river.  When the incident occurred, the Detroit River was 95 percent ice-covered.Originally the released product was thought to be a #6 oil, but laboratory analysis proved it was a #4 fuel with density of 0.93.  The original estimate of 10,000 to 30,000 gallons proved a conundrum as only about 300 gallons was observed in the river.  Later volume refinements had the number at officially  less than 900 gallons and most likely around 300 gallons.  The City of Detroit assumed responsibility for the spill and immediately hired Marine Pollution Control.  Only a limited response was possible due to the ice.  A portion of the spilled oiled was recovered by removing the oil-stained ice accessible from the shorelines.  The Detroit City Laboratory performed the first analysis on the oil, determining that it was a #4 rather than a #6, and that it was a ""floater"".

Berman went aground in the surf zone off Escambron Beach in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The barge grounded on a hard bottom consisting of rocky substrate with scattered coral after its towing cable parted.The barge had a capacity of three million gallons but was reportedly only half full.  The cargo, a heavy #6 fuel oil, began spilling and impacted nearby shoreline and shallow intertidal habitats immediately.  No estimated leakage rate was available.  Due to strong northerly winds, the surf at the grounding site was quite strong creating a hazardous situation as they pounded the deck of the vessel. The responsible party initially assumed responsibility for the spill, but very quickly expended the ten million dollar limit of their insurance policy.  Full federal funding of the spill occurred at 0600 on January 14 and it became a United States Coast Guard (USCG) directed response.The USCG Gulf Strike Team (GST) was brought onscene and immediately began lightering operations for the barge.  Skimming and lightering operations were effective and removed an estimated 17,700 barrels of oil from the water and leaking barge.  Shoreline cleanup and assessment began almost immediately.  Little progress was made however due to continued leaking of fresh oil from the barge.  Cleaned areas became re-oiled and areas not yet cleaned became more heavily impacted.  Protection strategies were employed for areas at risk that were not yet oiled.  Intensive shoreline cleanup was postponed for the most heavily impacted areas until the sources of re-oiling could be stopped.  Two shallow lagoons near the grounding site were most heavily impacted.  Oil, in the form of large mats, accumulated on the surface and on the bottom of the lagoons.  Submerged oil posed a major cleanup problem during the response.  It was eventually partially removed by divers, vacuum transfer units, and a dredge.  Waste and oily water from dredging operations were collected and separated in a series of swimming pools arranged to decant and filter the effluent from the dredge before returning the filtered water to the sea. On January 15, the barge was refloated, towed to a scuttling site 20 miles northeast of San Juan, and sunk.  This operation was carefully reviewed by the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC), Navy Superintendent of Salvage (SUPSALV), the GST, and NOAA.  The Regional Response Team (RRT) was consulted and on-scene trustee representatives were given an opportunity to discuss the operation and voice their concerns.  It was agreed by all that the sinking of the barge was the best alternative.  Continued re-oiling of the nearshore environment from the unrecoverable oil left onboard was delaying cleanup and preventing resource recovery.  Resource concerns offshore were minimal and it was hoped that the amount of residual oil left on the barge when it sank would be small and have little impact.  Shorelines at risk from any oil released during the scuttling operations were predicted to be on northwestern Puerto Rico, Mona Island, and Hispaniola.Shoreline cleaning continued in earnest and was more successful with the barge removed.  Surface and buried oil along sand beaches was removed following cleanup guidelines.  Beachrock, riprap, and seawalls were cleaned with pressure washing and chemical cleaners as approved.  Some inaccessible areas were left to clean naturally.  Cleanup guidelines for oiled historical structures were developed and approved by trustees through the Heritage Resource Team.  These structures and resources were then cleaned according to those guidelines.On February 3, oil impacts along northwestern Puerto Rico were reported.  A convergence zone at the northwest corner of the island concentrated debris and oil still being released from the scuttled barge.  Impacts were primarily along 12 miles of shoreline, from Isabella to Borinquen.  This oil was buried as oily sand layers and submerged as oil and sand mats in the protected areas or crenulate bays.  A separate command post was established on the west end of the island and assessments and cleanup operations began immediately.  Crews removed the stranded oil quickly to prevent additional burial.  Cleanup efforts were intensified in this area to minimize risks to nesting sea turtles, whose arrival was imminent. All necessary cleanup guidelines and inspection criteria were in place by mid-February.  With the exception of nearshore reef fish and benthic organisms near the barge's grounding site, there were very few impacts to biological resources.   Seagrasses were oiled near the grounding site.  Very few birds were affected and no substantiated reports of spill related mortalities to reptiles or mammals were received.  The impacted shoreline was divided into 18 shoreline segments or zones.  Most of these zones were cleaned and inspected following the ""how clean is clean"" guidelines, and approved by the FOSC by April 4.  All other zones were signed off by April 25, with the exception of zone 18, which was completed on May 27.  Once approved as clean, each zone entered a monitoring and maintenance phase to address any additional oiling that may occur.  USCG district 7.  Keyword: endangered species, bioremediation."

MSO Tampa closed the port to vessel traffic.  This collision caused three separate emergencies:  1) the Balsa 37,  which was carrying a cargo of phosphate rock, was severely damaged on the starboard side, was listing at an increasing rate, and was in danger of capsizing in the channel; 2) the Ocean 255, which was loaded with jet fuel, gasoline, and a small amount of diesel fuel was burning out of control just south of Mullet Key; and 3) the Bouchard 155  was holed at the port bow spilling approximately 8,000 barrels of #6 fuel oil into Tampa Bay.Stabilizing the vessels was the first priority of responders.  By 2200 the Ocean 255 barge fire was extinguished and the GST was conducting cooling procedures and maintaining a fire watch.  Lightering operations were well underway on the Bouchard 155 barge in preparation for moving it to dockage in the Port of Tampa where it would be cleaned before dry docking.  The Balsa 37 was intentionally grounded outside the shipping channel to prevent it from capsizing and to open the channel for traffic while repairs and stability evaluations were conducted.August 10 overflight observations showed a three- to six-meter wide band of oil along the beaches.  By the next day, this band appeared to be about half its original width.  Systematic shoreline surveys were conducted and oil was found buried by two to eight inches of clean sand deposited during high tide.  Cleanup crews focused on manually removing the band of surface oil high on the beach.  A plan was developed to remove the subsurface oil without generating large volumes of sediment for handling, disposal, and replacement.  The plan called for mechanical removal of the heavy buried layers, manual removal of moderately oiled sediments, and mechanically pushing stained sand onto the lower part of the beach for surf washing.  Pompoms were strung along the surf zone to collect any oil refloated during the surf washing.By August 11 the status of the vessels had improved substantially.  The response focus began to change from  emergency issues to skimming operations, protection strategies, forecasts, and planning.Meanwhile, cleanup crews were contending with very thick oil that had been deposited around some mangrove islands.  Tarmats formed when sediment was mixed with oil along the shallow flats surrounding the islands.  Large thick mats coated mangrove roots, oyster and seagrass beds, and tidal mud flats.  Most of this oil was vacuumed out using vacuum transfer units on grounded barges staged around the islands and shallow areas.  Seawalls within the bay were being washed using high-pressure water heated to 110 degrees.The GST was onscene throughout the spill response.  They provided support with the Vessel of Opportunity Skimming System as well as the fire fighting, monitoring, and lightering of the Ocean 255 barge.Roughly 14.5 miles of fine-grained sand beach from St. Petersburg Beach north to Redington Shores Beach were affected by this spill.  Sand beaches on Egmont Key at the entrance to Tampa Bay were also oiled.  Additionally, four mangrove islands inside the entrance to Boca Ciega Bay at Johns Pass and two small areas of Spartina marsh were oiled.  Jetties, seawalls, and riprap within the bay and at Johns Pass and Blind Pass were also oiled to varying degrees.  It is estimated that over 30 miles of residential seawalls were oiled within Boca Ciega Bay.  Some impact also occurred on the northern side of Mullet Key at Bonne Fortune Key in fringing mangroves.Seawalls, jetties, walkways, and riprap were cleaned by high-pressure hot-water washes.  PES-51 was considered for some of these cleaning needs, but after observing comparison tests performed by the manufacturer, the RP decided against its use.Cleanup of submerged tarmats offshore is ongoing.

Oil leaked from a severed discharge line near the bottom of one or both of these 54,000-barrel capacity tanks.  It then overflowed the containment dike and moved toward the beach 250 feet away.  VIWAPA personnel constructed sand-based containment trenches and berms along the beach to contain the oil.  They also diverted oil to a diesel storage tank containment area.  Oil began to leak through the trenches, proceeding down the sloping base toward the shoreline.  U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Marine Safety Office (MSO) San Juan personnel flew over the area on September 21 and estimated that approximately 48 barrels of oil had overflowed the trench and entered the harbor, impacting the sand beaches west of the facility.MSO and USCG Atlantic Area Strike Team (AST) personnel arrived on-scene on September 22.  They immediately began working with VIWAPA and contractor personnel to locate and stop the leak.  The Strike Team lowered the level of oil in the containment areas and secured the leak on September 25. The containment wall had been blown by the wind onto a ten-inch transfer pipe, rupturing the pipe.  An open valve had permitted the oil to escape through the broken pipe.  A total of 14,076 barrels escaped from this tank between September 18 and 25.  Approximately 1,000 barrels overflowed the containment area and entered the water.  Three miles of sand beaches were heavily oiled, with some impacts east of the power plant in the harbor area.  Some of the oil refloated, but local meteorological and oceanographic conditions isolated the resultant secondary impacts to previously oiled beaches.

NOAA reported that the shoreline is mostly sand beaches, gravel beaches, mixed sand and gravel beaches, and rocky shores or seawalls.  The offshore islands that are surrounded by mangroves would not be affected if the winds continued to be easterly.  NOAA estimated that the slick would tend to the west or northwest and would come ashore on beaches inshore and to the west of the facility.  This could have occurred for a considerable distance, depending on the weather conditions and local small-scale oceanographic circulation patterns.  There was a small chance that, with a large enough quantity of free-floating, unrestricted oil and continued easterly winds, the oil might round Punta Guayanilla and impact the beaches of Punta Verraco and Bahia de Guayanilla.  If this did happen, NOAA advised that the large mangrove forests of Bahia de Guayanilla be protected.  NOAA further advised that the oil would persist in the environment, with a small quantity evaporating during weathering.  Reef impacts would be low because the oil is not very soluble; there would probably be no impacts at all below the surface, although there could be severe shoreline impacts.   In addition, NOAA reported that the oil would strand at the high tide line and persist or wash away, depending on sand and gravel transport on that beach.  Finally, sticky, weathered bunker oil would adhere to rocky shores and mangroves, killing the mangroves when the oil got into the root system. Turtles currently nesting in Puerto Rico and along the sandy beaches of Punta Verraco were at risk.  Oiled adults would suffer irritated mucous membranes and would develop lesions that would probably result in an increased risk of infection.  Oiled hatchlings would probably die, whether they were on the beach or floating offshore.  Oiled turtle eggs and newly hatched turtles had a greater than 80% chance of mortality.  There were many species of birds present, including the brown pelican, a federally listed endangered species.  If oiled feathers remained untreated, the birds would die as a result of loss of insulation or ingestion of oil during preening.  The diving birds (brown pelican, brown booby, terns), wading birds  (herons and egrets), shorebirds (plovers, sandpipers), and ducks were the most likely to be affected because they would dive and wade into the oil slick.  Seabirds (magnificent frigate bird) and gulls skim the surface when feeding and would also be affected.  Large numbers of gulls would also be impacted.  USCG district 7."

Due to the high viscosity of the oil and severe weather conditions, containment or dispersal at sea was impossible.  Because the spring tides in this region have an average tidal range of 26 feet, many areas along the coast could not be boomed effectively.

The vessel began to leak cargo from the damaged bow section.  Due to the threat of explosion and fire, the Port Commandant ordered the Urquiola out of the harbor, away from the refinery and town of 200,000 inhabitants.  While being assisted out of the harbor by two tugs, the leaking vessel grounded again, further rupturing the bow tanks.  All of the crew, except for the captain and pilot, abandoned the ship when it began to list.Two hours later the vessel exploded, killing the captain.  Approximately 513,000 barrels of oil burned in the subsequent 16-hour fire.  Burning oil spread out from the vessel and was eventually extinguished by the cooling effect of the seawater.  Dense clouds of smoke were blown over the town of La Coruña.  A safety zone one mile in radius was established around the vessel after air monitors detected high levels of volatile gases.  Despite these precautions, a second explosion and fire rocked the vessel on the morning of May 14.Between May 12 and May 21, oil was estimated to be leaking at a rate of 2,200 barrels per day.  An estimated 180,000-220,000 barrels of the cargo polluted the Spanish coast.  On May 21, a smaller tanker and tug began lightering the Urquiola.  About 50,000 barrels of crude oil had been removed from the vessel by May 25, when lightering operations were halted by rough seas.  Ten to fifteen foot seas detached a large section of the bow.  On June 8, the stern section, containing an estimated 22,000 barrels of bunker fuel, was towed to a more protected area five miles to the west.  The stern was partially lightered before developing a crack in one of the tanks that resulted in further, limited leakage.Following the fire, the Spanish Navy and a fleet of commercial vessels applied over 2,000 tons of chemical dispersants to the Urquiola and surrounding waters in spite of resistance mounted by Spanish oceanographers.

Clean Water Inc. was contracted by  Steuart Transportation, the barge owner, to stage pollution abatement equipment near the scene in the event of a spill during salvage operations.  An underwater survey of the barge on February 4 reported no oil leaking from the barge, however, oil patches and light sheen were reported in the surrounding area on February 5.  After the STC-101  was refloated on February 6 by the McLean Construction Company, the barge was intentionally grounded in Ingram Bay for dewatering operations.  Extensive damage to the port side was discovered.  Severe wind and weather conditions as well as poorly maintained and improperly secured cargo hatches may have contributed to the oil spillage.After the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Hampton Roads received several reports of oil and birds washing up on surrounding shorelines, a Federal spill was declared on February 8.

The vessel was old and the oceanic crossing was scheduled to be her final journey.  After delivery of her cargo, the ship was destined for destruction as scrap.  Shortly following departure, a welded seam ruptured between two steel plates on the starboard side, well above the water line.  The U.S. harbor authorities refused permission to return to Los Angeles.  The vessel then proceeded to Ensenada Harbor in Baja California to have the ruptured seam repaired by welding.  Authorities in Ensenada refused permission to have the repair work done within the Harbor so welders were taken aboard and the ship proceeded offshore an estimated 60 miles to have the welding accomplished.  At this distance offshore, the vessel may have been situated within the influence of the southward-flowing California Current System. Welding repairs were completed successfully.  Unfortunately, a dense fog settled throughout the region.  A single sun sight was made within the two days offshore, to establish the ship's position.  On this basis, a return to Ensenada was undertaken to offload the welders.  In the early morning hours of March 29 1957, the vessel struck the coast at a location about 64 km south of Ensenada Harbor.  The bow grounded against one side of the entrance to a small cove on a predominantly rocky shore.  The stern apparently swung around and stuck on a shallow spot midway across the cove (henceforth Tampico cove) entrance.  The hull thus served as a breakwater across about 2/3 of the cove entrance, creating fairly calm conditions landward of the hull.  The crew and passengers were able to disembark and reach shore safely in the lee of the hull.  A portion of the oil cargo was liberated at the time of grounding.  The remainder escaped over the next 6-9 months as the ship was slowly torn asunder by pounding surf.   The location was in a remote section of coastline so no countermeasures were taken to remove a portion of the cargo or lessen ensuing pollution of the shore.  A few shacks scattered along the coast here housed native fishermen and their families.  The site was accessible by an extremely rough road, best negotiated by 4-wheel drive vehicles.
