The vessel sank in 30 feet of water, 6-8 miles west of the pass entrance.  The vessel was reported to have approximately 7000 gallons of diesel fuel oil and 30 gallons of lube oil onboard.  The amount released was unknown.  Subsequent USCG overflights observed no visible sheens associated with the fishing vessel.  Since no sheens were observed, there was reason to suspect that a majority of the diesel fuel was still on-board.  The USCG considered the sunken vessel a hazard to both navigation and the environment.  While diesel is generally considered a nonpersistant oil with a relatively high evaporation rate and natural dispersion rate, most diesel fuel oils are, at the same time, highly toxic.  The NOAA SSC was asked to provide information to assess potential spill trajectories and possible environmental affects related to the sunken fishing boat.  NOAA also provided an evaluation of potential damages under possible spill scenarios using the Type A Model.  This information was used to develop both a response strategy and a cost-benefit analysis related to salvage operations and cost.  Using the information provided by NOAA, the MSO was able to develop and negotiate a cost effective salvage plan.  The diesel fuel was pumped off the vessel eliminating the environmental hazard.

Phone calls soon began to filter into the local fire station describing a strong diesel smell within a cluster of homes at Scottish Pike in South Knoxville, Tennessee.   When a fire truck arrived on-scene, a fountain of diesel fuel was spewing heavily onto an adjacent house and an immediate evacuation of six homes took place.   At the same time notification to shut down its pipeline was given to Colonial Pipeline (RP).  They were also told to boom off Goose Creek, at the junction of the creek and the Lake.  The diesel had flowed down an embankment to Goose Creek then into the lake and river creating a slick 60 feet wide  and several miles long.  The USCG was notified and dispatched a team from MSD Nashville and three members of the USCG GST.  EPA arrived on-scene the morning of February 13 and assumed the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) position since the spill originated from shore.  The cause of the spill will be investigated by the National Transit Safety Board (NTSB).  The spill occurred at river mile (RM) 647.5, which is below the City of Knoxville's  water intakes.  Additionally the river is controlled by a dam ( Fort Loudoun Lake Dam) that shut down operations soon after notification of the spill.  By midmorning the RP and contracted response organizations had boomed off three locations down river.  Because it was dyed red the diesel produced a very noticeable slick. The current in the area was flowing at 1 knot and a little faster in the river bend just a couple of miles downstream from Goose Creek in the area called Sequoyah Hills.  From there the river opens up wider and the current drops off significantly.   As the diesel spread out, rainbow sheens developed.  This was prevalent between Sequoyah Hills and a mile down river to Looney Island.  As the spilled diesel weathered, silver sheens became more prevalent after day two and even more on day three.  Additionally silver steaks could be seen from the air  leeching off a point at RM 645.  South of Looney Island to Sequoyah Park the diesel was observed to be in streaks and patches.  On shore the diesel penetrated deep into the riprap shorelines and maybe an inch into the fine-grain sand shores from Goose Creek to Sequoyah Hills.  Oil film and a brown frothy mousse could be seen downstream of Sequoyah Hills. Additional shoreline impacts were at the booming site at Sequoyah Park where unweathered diesel pooled at the junction of the boom and shoreline.  Some oiled debris was located at RM 639 near Maxey's Boat Dock.

The tug and barge, en route to Dutch Harbor with approximately 47,620 barrels of diesel on board, encountered extremely rough weather.  The pump room and starboard aft tanks, which had been empty, were now flooded, causing the barge to turn bow-up with approximately 80 feet of the barge above water and the remaining 200 feet below the surface.  The tug's crew members observed oil coming from the vicinity of the waste oil tanks in the stern area.  Although the barge owner speculated that the stern anchor had punctured the aft waste oil tank, the exact cause of the sinking was never determined.  The salvage vessel M/V Salvage Chief  hired by Seattle-based UMTB arrived on January 7 after an eight-day passage from Astoria, Oregon.  Meanwhile, the barge continued leaking diesel fuel as 50-60 knot winds and 20-25 foot seas pounded the area.

From the attitude of the barge, the owner's naval architects and salvage master speculated that four tanks remained filled with diesel fuel while the other tank's cargo was displaced by water.Initially, the owner requested resource agency clearance to move the barge to Stepovak Bay for lightering and repair operations.  As the barge, with the tug and tow line still attached, drifted northeast parallel to the coast, evaluations of Stepovak, Castle, Devil's, and Kuiukta bays, along the southeastern side of the Alaska Peninsula, were requested of NOAA.  The upright-floating barge was extremely difficult to tow.

The Chief Engineer on board the Pac Baroness activated the vessel's bilge pumps and a tug attached a towline to the vessel to prevent the Pac Baroness from drifting toward the shoreline.  By 1607, the Pac Baroness was still  taking on water and was  close to sinking.  The Pac Baroness sank at 1618 on September 21, resulting in a release of approximately 9,200 barrels of oil and quantities of copper ore over the next 20 days.

The barge was loaded with 20,000 barrels of Number 6 Fuel Oil.  Fifteen minutes later, the E-24 was standing almost vertically with about 20 feet of the barge visible above the surface of the water.  At the time of the incident, there was heavy rain, 5-6 foot seas, and winds from the east at 25 knots.  The incident took place in an area known as ""The Race"", the passage between the Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean, which typically has severe rip tides and rough, unpredictable seas.  On November 23 at 2250 the barge sank in a keel-up position in 185 feet of water.  Approximately 15-24 barrels of Number 6 fuel oil was forced from compartment vents, and as much as 47 barrels of diesel fuel was lost from the pump room. The cargo compartments were not damaged during the sinking.Oil from the barge formed a slick measuring 0.5 miles long by 500 yards wide as observed on November 23.  Cleanup of the Long Island shoreline began on November 24 and was completed by December 5. Approximately 1000 gallons of oily debris were recovered.  Later releases of oil occurred during the salvage operations, but skimming equipment was on station and recovered most of that lost oil immediately.  An estimated 225 birds were affected by the spill, with 75 of these recovered dead.Salvage of the barge without damaging the intact cargo compartments was the major concern.  Due to heavy seas and limitations of equipment on scene, the exact position of the barge could not be determined and verified until December 19.  On January 3, 1986, the USCG On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) federalized the case as the responsible party, Eklof Transportation Co., Inc. was unable to meet the deadlines imposed by the OSC for performing the hull survey and inspection.Evaluation, planning, and mobilization for the salvage operations took place from January 3 to May 4, 1986.  The salvage plan was developed by the United States Navy Supervisor of Salvage (NAVSUPSALV) at the request of the OSC.  The OSC staff report was completed on March 3, and detailed three salvage options determined by the NAVSUPSALV.  After much deliberation, the OSC determined that the barge should be raised with its cargo intact.  Salvage operations took place from May 5 to May 30, 1986.  Approximately 235 gallons of oil were lost during the entire operation, of which 185 were recovered. The barge was inspected and in tow by the evening of May 29, and was moored at Mariners Harbor, Staten Island, New York by 1900, May 30.

The oil spread to East Bay, Tampa Bay and Hillsborough Bay and impacted 15 widely separated shorelines over a distance of approximately 20 miles.Personnel aboard the Howard Star failed to notify authorities of the discharge.  The  Coast Guard Marine Safety Office (MSO) Tampa was first notified by IMC on October 4 at 2025 that approximately 15 gallons of oil was in the water at the IMC terminal.  The Coast Guard discovered large quantities of floating oil streaming into Hillsborough Bay from the Port Sutton Canal.  The Environmental Coastal Pollution Cleanup Service (ECPCS) was notified of the spill and began mobilizing all available boom and cleanup equipment on October 5.  An additional cleanup contractor, Need-A-Diver, was contracted by the Coast Guard.  The Regional Response Team (RRT) was activated at 1115 on October 5, and the USCG Gulf Strike Team was requested.  Because the entire transit system was affected, the port was closed to help contain the oil.  The MSO and cleanup contractors deployed four sections of boom to prevent the oil from spreading further into the surrounding bays.  By October 9, approximately 643 barrels of oil had been recovered by the contractors and the Coast Guard.

The vessel was old and the oceanic crossing was scheduled to be her final journey.  After delivery of her cargo, the ship was destined for destruction as scrap.  Shortly following departure, a welded seam ruptured between two steel plates on the starboard side, well above the water line.  The U.S. harbor authorities refused permission to return to Los Angeles.  The vessel then proceeded to Ensenada Harbor in Baja California to have the ruptured seam repaired by welding.  Authorities in Ensenada refused permission to have the repair work done within the Harbor so welders were taken aboard and the ship proceeded offshore an estimated 60 miles to have the welding accomplished.  At this distance offshore, the vessel may have been situated within the influence of the southward-flowing California Current System. Welding repairs were completed successfully.  Unfortunately, a dense fog settled throughout the region.  A single sun sight was made within the two days offshore, to establish the ship's position.  On this basis, a return to Ensenada was undertaken to offload the welders.  In the early morning hours of March 29 1957, the vessel struck the coast at a location about 64 km south of Ensenada Harbor.  The bow grounded against one side of the entrance to a small cove on a predominantly rocky shore.  The stern apparently swung around and stuck on a shallow spot midway across the cove (henceforth Tampico cove) entrance.  The hull thus served as a breakwater across about 2/3 of the cove entrance, creating fairly calm conditions landward of the hull.  The crew and passengers were able to disembark and reach shore safely in the lee of the hull.  A portion of the oil cargo was liberated at the time of grounding.  The remainder escaped over the next 6-9 months as the ship was slowly torn asunder by pounding surf.   The location was in a remote section of coastline so no countermeasures were taken to remove a portion of the cargo or lessen ensuing pollution of the shore.  A few shacks scattered along the coast here housed native fishermen and their families.  The site was accessible by an extremely rough road, best negotiated by 4-wheel drive vehicles.  The main paved highway ran about 10-20 miles inland and the trip from there  to the study site required 2-3 hours.  Keyword: accidental grounding, diesel oil, mixing by surf."
