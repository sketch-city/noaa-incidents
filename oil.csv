These eruptions caused lahars, extensive fllooding, and mud flows around the Drift River Tank Farm, where oil from the Cook Inlet fields is temporarily stored prior to shipping out aboard tankers.    Currently, two of the four active tanks have 74,000 bbls of oil apiece. At 7:30 PM on March 23rd, ADEC and USCG conducted an over-flight to determine any potential threat to the tank farm and related facilities at the Drift River Terminal.  They observed extensive flooding to the area with mud flows to a depth of six feet in the area of the runway and ballast tank, but no significant penetration of the 18 to 20 foot high teritiary containment berm around the tank farm.  No oil or hazardous substance releases have been reported at this time.  Cook Inlet Pipeline Company, operator of the tank farm, is planning on-the-ground evaluation today of the teritiary berms, pumps, and other equipment and facilities necessary for the operation of the tank farm.   The Alaska Volcano Observatory is predicting additional explosive activity of the volcano in the near future, which combined with the extensive amount of snow and ice on the flanks of Redoubt could cause additional significant flooding and mud flows towards the Drift River Tank Farm.    The Coast Guard has asked the NOAA SSC to keep fully abreast of the situation and to participate in conference calls among the CG, the state, the tank farm operator and others.         The last  major explosive eruption of Redoubt volcano occurred on April 4.

None of the mud or water, however, penetrated the large dikes around the facility.   As an additional safety precaution, Chevron and Cook Inlet Pipeline decided to completely shut in the  DRTF and proceeded to draw down the oil in the two active storage tanks to minimal levels.    To achieve greater tank stability, 30,000 Bbls of fresh water was added to each of the two active tanks.        With no eruptions since April 4 and dome building in the volcano's throat dramatically decreasing, the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) decided to downgrade the threat level of the volcano from orange to yellow on June 29, 2009.   "

The sheening site is adjacent to a FUDS site in which the Army Corp of Engineers removed 2000 old drums containing only 100+ gallons of mixed petroleum fluids.  In addition to old military drums, the dump site has been used by locals for years and contains derelict fishing gear, batteries, old vehicles, some medical waste and on and on.  As a result, this response is being funded by CERCLA.  NOAA has asked the NWS to provide a weeks' worth of Spot forecasts beginning November 23 and is currently providing tidal data for the incident.   The Coast Guard assessed the situation, Nov. 28, when a six-man team consisting of Coast Guard, state of Alaska, and contractor reps flew to Port Heiden.     Their first impression was how much had changed at the dump site from the photos taken only one month previous.  No sheens or evidence of on-going releases was observed.   Numerous old fuel drums were in the intertidal zone, all seriously rusted and open to the environment.  In one and one-half months time, the shoreline embankment had eroded back from 10 to 40 feet.

The failure occurred below the ground near a pipe junction on the east side of Harbor Boulevard just south of Ventura, California.  Approximately 2,000 barrels of a heavy crude produced from a local field, percolated through the ground to the west and underneath the road.  The oil surfaced 50 yards west of Harbor Boulevard and entered a creek,  traveled along this creek approximately 150 yards to the south where it entered McGrath Lake.McGrath is a freshwater lake (approximately 800 by 100 yards) situated amongst medium-coarse grained sand dunes and is located 100 to 200 yards inshore of the intertidal zone.  The lake serves as a drainage basin for the surrounding agricultural fields and has no natural communication with the ocean.  To control the lake level, water is routinely pumped out of the lake and into the Pacific Ocean through a pipeline running through the dunes and onto the beach.  When the oil entered the lake, the pump was on and oil was discharged onto the sand beach and into the nearshore environment.  Less than 100 barrels of oil entered the ocean; the majority was contained in the lake, the creek, or was saturated in the sediment.The mouth of the Santa Clara river was bermed to prevent oil from entering the estuary.  To control the amount of water flowing through the spill site, water was diverted from the creek to the Santa Clara River via pumps.  Underflow dams and filter fences with sorbent pompoms were installed along the creek.  The vegetated shoreline of the creek and the lake, consisting mostly of tules, was heavily coated with oil.  Because all pumping operations had ceased, the water level in the lake was rising and began covering over already impacted shoreline and affecting more habitat as it rose.  After consulting with the Regional Water Quality Control Board, pumping the lake into the ocean began again and the water level was lowered to where it had been before the spill.  USCG district 11.

Apparently, a blowout preventer (BOP) valve malfunction caused the initial blowout.  Although the BOP had successfully shut the annulus between the drill pipe and well casing, the blind rams failed to shear through the drill pipe that was still in the well casing.  Therefore, oil and gas flowed out of the well, up the drill pipe, and onto the platform where it ignited.  The oil discharge increased after the escaping gas and oil forced the drill pipe out of the well.  The initial fire was extinguished by October 17.  As of October 28, the well was still spewing out a yellow gas/crude mix  60-100 feet in the air.  The owners of the well, Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), and the Mexican Navy participated in cleanup operations.

Winds reported from the NW would tend to move the floating crude oil onto the New Jersey shore in the Penns Grove areas. . Recommend that Oldmans Creek receive priority attention for booming. . After the tide changes, Raccon Creek should receive booming attention. . Deflection booming or stnadby booming for the Christina River should be made available if overflight observations indicate enough oil has escaped Sun Oil's efforts at booming the spill at the source. .

Four boats and 14 Coast Guard personnel assisted in fire fighting and lifesaving operations.  Two Coast Guard pollution team investigators from the Houston Port Safety Station were already on their way to the Shell terminal when the accident occurred.  They led the rescue of the burning vessel's boatswain from the forecastle.  Representatives from both the USCG Pacific and Gulf Strike Teams (PST and AST) monitored all phases of the cleanup.  Eighteen different cleanup companies were involved in the cleanup operations.  Since the spill occurred over a holiday weekend, it was difficult to recruit companies with equipment specifically needed for this spill.  One crew member and two radar repairmen aboard the SS Chevron Hawaii  were killed and 13 people were injured.  Even though six tugs were available within the barge slip, no attempt was made by the Shell Oil Company dockman or the tugboat operators to move any adjacent barges into the channel where they might have been safe from the fire.  Also, the dockman left the scene without activating the emergency cut-off switch.  This would have assured that any adjacent barges' cargo openings were properly secured.

The water depth at the wellhead site is about 50 m (164 feet). The IXTOC I was being drilled by the SEDCO 135, a semi-submersible platform on lease to Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX). A loss of drilling mud circulation caused the blowout to occur. The oil and gas blowing out of the well ignited, causing the platform to catch fire. The burning platform collapsed into the wellhead area hindering any immediate attempts to control the blowout. PEMEX hired blowout control experts and other spill control experts including Red Adair, Martech International of Houston, and the Mexican diving company, Daivaz. The Martech response included 50 personnel on site, the remotely operated vehicle TREC, and the submersible Pioneer I. The TREC attempted to find a safe approach to the Blowout Preventer (BOP). The approach was complicated by poor visibility and debris on the seafloor including derrick wreckage and 3000 meters of drilling pipe. Divers were eventually able to reach and activate the BOP, but the pressure of the oil and gas caused the valves to begin rupturing. The BOP was reopened to prevent destroying it. Two relief wells were drilled to relieve pressure from the well to allow response personnel to cap it. Norwegian experts were contracted to bring in skimming equipment and containment booms, and to begin cleanup of the spilled oil.

The vessel had been traveling off course at nearly full speed when the grounding occurred.  The Arrow broke into two pieces on February 12, spilling between 77,000 and 82,500 barrels of Bunker C Oil into the  waters of the bay.  Visibility at the time of the grounding was between five and six miles, water temperatures were very cold and there was ice in the bays and inlets.  There were high winds and seas at the time of the spill.  This worked to spread the oil into Chedabucto Bay, and the oil eventually impacted approximately 300 kilometers of the bay's shoreline.  "

A massive mixture of oil, gas, and drilling mud roared up the drill casing and spewed out onto the platform.  Well A-21 was capped on February 7 with 13,000 barrels of heavy drilling mud.  Oil continued to vent from natural faults several hundred yards from the platform, in tract 4042 between the coast and a chain of islands.  The faults released a total of 100,000 barrels of oil until December 1969.  A record-breaking storm immediately before the incident contributed to the large amount of oiled debris that needed to be collected as part of the spill response.  On February 2, the National Pollution Contingency Plan, instituted by President Johnson in 1968, went into effect for the first time.  The Federal Water Pollution Control Administration was on-scene to monitor the well-killing process and cleanup.  Red Adair was brought in to provide expertise capping the well.  To aid in predicting the slick movement, the National Weather Service set up a local station to monitor winds and tides.  Weather during the cleanup was moderate except for a storm on February 4 and 5 that temporarily halted cleanup by damaging booms that were protecting harbors and marinas.  The majority of the cleanup was completed within 45 days.  Commercial fishing was completely closed in the area from February until April.  Although the environmental effects of the spill were relatively minimal, economic effects were extensive due to loss of fishing income, loss of recreational facilities, and damage to personal property.

At the time of the incident the weather consisted of southwesterly gale force winds, overcast skies, heavy swells, and poor visibility.  Only ten of the 34 crew members survived the accident.  The stern section of the vessel sank after about two hours, while the bow section drifted southwest with the Agulhas Current.  The bow was presumed to sink at 30 06 S, 031 54 E, approximately 40 miles from the initial breakup.  All the ship's cargo, 334,043 barrels of Kuwait crude oil, eventually spilled into the Indian Ocean.  The response was led by the Port Captain of Durban.  Since the economy of Natal, South Africa, depended on the upcoming winter tourist season, the primary response goal was to keep the oil from impacting the mainly recreational shoreline.  Dispersant operations were organized by personnel from the Department of Fisheries and the Department of Industries.  Other parties involved in the response include the Department of Transportation, South African Defense Force, the Durban Corporation, the Oceanographic Research Institute, the Natal Anti-Shark Measures Board, and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.  Wildlife impacts were minimal.  Duration of response was approximately 20 days with an estimated cost of $420,000.  Keyword: Adverse weather conditions, sinking.."

The aft section of the vessel drifted farther into the harbor and grounded, while the forward section was anchored in place.  Three days later, U. S. Navy tugs tried to tow the forward section out of the harbor.  Adverse weather hindered the operation, and eventually drove the forward section farther into the harbor.  On March 10, the forward section broke open in heavy seas and released more oil into the water.

Ships of the Royal Navy carrying detergents were en route to the scene within four hours of the grounding.The response command post was established at Plymouth.  The Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy implemented an early warning system for oil movement.  A panel of expert scientists was assembled to consider scientific problems involved with the cleanup procedure.  Local authorities were instrumental in dealing with the oil beached within their jurisdictions.A detergent, primarily BP1002, was sprayed on much of the floating oil to emulsify and disperse it.  Manual methods were used for removal of oil on many of the sandy beaches, although the dissected nature of the shoreline made it impossible to clean the whole coastline.
